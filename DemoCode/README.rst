A demo is available at http://13.92.41.254:3000/

Notes:
-------

- Only interfaces and CPU are real device data
- *Interface Bandwidth is randomly generated
- Layer Two tables are static with random bandwidth if category exist.

Why?
-----

CSRs' don't produce environmental data, Qos, and it's not a layer 2 device.
